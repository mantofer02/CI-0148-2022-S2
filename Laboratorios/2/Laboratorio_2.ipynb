Por lo tanto, una mejora que se le podria agregar a nuestro árbol de decisión es que antes de cada iteración o \"split\" se genere un balance sobre el dataset. Otra mejora que se le podría agregar a nuestro es mitigar los \"grandes cambios\" que pueden llegar a generar valores pequeños. Esto se debe a que, debido a pequeñas variaciones de valores dentro de un dataset, se puede llegar a generar un árbol de decisión completamente diferente debido al criterio de separación. Así mismo se puede incluir un análisis de correlación para determinar cuáles son las variables más relevantes y de esta manera priorizar y seleccionar de mejor manera las columnas a particionar.\n","\n","\n","¿ Qué tanto varían los resultados para el mismo set de datos de\n","entrenamiento-prueba?\n","\n","\n","\n","> Al ver los resultado de las matrices de confusión podemos ver que los resultados no varian en sí.
